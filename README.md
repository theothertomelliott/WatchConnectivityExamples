# WatchConnectivity Tutorial

This is a companion repo to the tutorial [Keeping iOS and watchOS2 apps synchronized with WatchConnectivity](http://telliott.io/2015/08/11/how-to-communicate-between-ios-and-watchos2.html) at telliott.io. The completed app is a simple example of sending state from an iOS 9 app to a watchOS 2 app.

There are separate branches for the [Swift](https://github.com/theothertomelliott/WatchConnectivityTutorial/tree/Swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/theothertomelliott/WatchConnectivityTutorial/tree/Objective-C) examples.

**Please note:** These examples were written under XCode 7 Beta 5. Should future betas or the official release of XCode 7 break these examples, I will endeavour to fix them, but if you encounter a bug, please do let me know by raising via an [Issue](https://github.com/theothertomelliott/WatchConnectivityExamples/issues) or reach me via Twitter ([@theotherelliott](https://twitter.com/theotherelliott)).
